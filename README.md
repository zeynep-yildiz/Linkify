## What It Does

- **Cleans URLs**: Strips tracking parameters, keeps the good stuff
- **Privacy-focused**: All processing happens on your device - no data sent anywhere
- **Works everywhere**: Supports 50+ platforms including YouTube, Twitter/X, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, and more
- **Fast**: Optimized for speed and efficiency
- **Lightweight**: Pure Swift, no external dependencies

## What Gets Removed vs. What Stays

### Gets Removed (Tracking stuff)
These are the parameters that get stripped out:
- `si=abc123` (Spotify session IDs)
- `s=20` (Twitter/X tracking)
- `igsh=abc123` (Instagram sharing)
- `utm_source=test` (Google Analytics)
- `utm_medium=social` (Google Analytics)
- `ref=test` (Referral tracking)
- `fbclid=abc123` (Facebook click IDs)
- `gclid=abc123` (Google Ads)
- ...and plenty more!

### Stays (Important content)
These are the parameters that matter and get kept:
- `id=123` (Content IDs)
- `track=123` (Spotify track IDs)
- `status=123` (Twitter status IDs)
- `p/123/` (Instagram post IDs)
- `v=abc123` (Video IDs)
- `playlist=abc123` (Playlist IDs)
- `channel=abc123` (Channel IDs)

## Getting Started

### Swift Package Manager

Add Linkify to your Xcode project:
1. Go to File â†’ Add Package Dependencies
2. Paste this URL: `https://github.com/zeynep-yildiz/Linkify.git`
3. Click Add Package

Or if you prefer, add it to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/zeynep-yildiz/Linkify.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

## How to Use It

### Basic URL Cleaning

```swift
import Linkify

// Clean up a Spotify URL
let dirtyURL = "https://open.spotify.com/track/123?si=abc123&utm_source=email"
let cleanURL = URLCleaner.cleanURL(dirtyURL)
// Result: "https://open.spotify.com/track/123"

// Clean up a Twitter URL
let twitterURL = "https://twitter.com/user/status/456?s=20&ref_src=email"
let cleanTwitter = URLCleaner.cleanURL(twitterURL)
// Result: "https://twitter.com/user/status/456"
```

### Check URL Status

```swift
// See if a URL is already clean
let isClean = URLCleaner.isAlreadyClean("https://example.com")
// Result: true

// Check if a URL needs cleaning
let needsCleaning = URLCleaner.needsCleaning("https://example.com?utm_source=test")
// Result: true
```

### Validate URLs

```swift
// Check if a URL can be cleaned (valid format)
let isValid = URLCleaner.isCleanable("https://example.com")
// Result: true

let isInvalid = URLCleaner.isCleanable("not a url")
// Result: false
```

## Real Examples

Here's what the transformation looks like:

| Platform | Before (Messy) | After (Clean) |
